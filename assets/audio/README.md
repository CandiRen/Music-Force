# Audio Samples

Place your instrument and effect audio clips in this folder. Suggested naming:

```
assets/audio/<instrument-id>_hit.wav
```

Each clip should be a short, percussive note recorded around middle C (261.63 Hz). The game time-stretches these samples to fit other notes; using clean, loop-free recordings yields the best result.
